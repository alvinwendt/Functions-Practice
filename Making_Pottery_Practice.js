// # ****Making Pottery****

// In this exercise, you will be defining some functions that perform the individual tasks involved in making pottery. Pottery minions that will do all the little things needed to make beautiful pieces of dirt art.
// Time to deconstruct the process of making pottery.

// 1.  Buy a big lump of clay
// 2.  Use a pottery wheel to turn the clay into a bowl
// 3.  Put the bowl into a kiln for a bisque firing
// 4.  Apply glaze to bowl
// 5. Put glazed bowl in kiln for final firing
// 6.  ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°Â (*haha, yeah right*)

// ### **Requirements for Your Minions**

// ### ****Purchasing Clay****

// Define a function namedÂ buyClay. The function needs no parameters. It should return an object with no properties on it yet.

// ### **Throw a Bowl**

// Define a function namedÂ makePottery. You need to pass it the empty object thatÂ buyClayÂ produced, so it needs a single parameter to capture that value and use it.
// The function should perform the task of adding a new property namedÂ shape, and its value should be "Bowl". The function should then return the object after the new property was added.
// **Reminder: When a function returns a value, you should store that value in a variable**

// ### **Bisque Firing**

// Define a function namedÂ bisqueFire. You need to give it the object thatÂ makePotteryÂ produced, so it needs a single parameter to capture that value and use it.
// The function should perform the task of adding a new property namedÂ readyForGlazing, and its value should beÂ true. The function should then return the object after the new property was added.

// ### **Glaze the Bowl**

// Define a function namedÂ glazePottery. You need to give it the object thatÂ bisqueFireÂ produced, so it needs a single parameter to capture that value and use it.
// The function should check if the pottery has been bisque fired already and is ready for glazing. If it has not, you should log the following message to the console.

// Make sure you bisque fire the pottery before you glaze it.

// If the pottery has been bisque fired, the function should perform the task of adding a new property namedÂ glazing, and its value should be "Midnight Blue". The function should then return the object after the new property was added.
// ****

// ### **Fire the Bowl**


const firedPottery1400 = finalFiring(glazedPottery, 1400)
console.log(firedPottery1400)
Also test if the temperature is correct, check that the pottery is not cracked.

const firedPottery1200 = finalFiring(glazedPottery, 1200)
console.log(firedPottery1200)
// ****


// ### **Optional Challenge**

// **Reminder: When a function returns a value, you should store that value in a variable**
// Start with purchasing some clay, and then pass the object to each function, in order, so that the finalÂ console.log()Â should have an object with all properties on it.


{
  shape: 'Bowl',
  readyForGlazing: true,
  glazing: 'Midnight Blue',
  cracked: false
}

// **Helpful hints**
// You can expand the hints below if you are stuck and don't know what to do. Make sure you try a few times and fail, and then talk with your teammates before looking at the hints.Hint: Final firing function definition


const finalFiring = (potteryObject, temperature) => {

}


// Hint: Cracked or not cracked


const finalFiring = (potteryObject, temperature) => {
    if (temperature > 1200) {
        // Add cracked property with value of true
    }
    else {
        // Add cracked property with value of false
    }
}
